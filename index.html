            <p>Take this simple green salad, which has been my go-to holiday salad for five years now.I’ve brought it to
                too
                many Friendsgivings to count, and my family has enjoyed it at Thanksgiving as well. It’s beautiful, easy
                to
                make, and a guaranteed crowd pleaser.This salad features fresh spring greens, tart Granny Smith apple,
                sweet
                dried cranberries and creamy goat cheese, tossed in a simple apple cider vinaigrette</p>

            <img src="food-network-main/images/food/Project Cover.png" alt="">
            <p>Some recipes should be kept simple as nature intended them to be, and in my opinion, Pumpkin Soup is one
                of
                those dishes. The natural flavour of pumpkin is good enough that you need very little to make a
                beautiful,
                creamy, full flavoured soup.</p>

            <img src="food-network-main/images/food/Project Cover8.png" alt="">
            <p>This recipe is so versatile, you can substitute your favorite vegetables; red pepper for green pepper,
                white
                or green onion for red onion. Adding feta cheese makes a nice variation, but since feta is quite salty
                itself start with less salt when you add the seasonings.Chickpea Salad is a complete meal that is low in
                fat, high in protein and incredibly delicious! A super power salad that is so satisfying, and …fun!</p>
